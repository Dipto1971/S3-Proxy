                    S3FS INTEGRATION TECHNICAL REPORT
                           s3-proxy Project
                        Date: June 5, 2025
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================
This report documents the resolution of a critical s3fs integration issue with 
the s3-proxy system. The issue prevented s3fs from reading file content despite 
successful write and listing operations. Root cause was identified as missing 
HEAD request support in s3-proxy, which s3fs requires for file metadata retrieval.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
================================================================================

Initial Issue Description:
--------------------------
- s3fs could successfully mount to s3-proxy endpoint (localhost:8080)
- s3fs write operations worked correctly (echo "content" > file.txt)
- s3fs listing operations worked correctly (ls command)
- s3fs read operations FAILED (cat commands returned empty content)
- Files appeared with 0 bytes size despite containing encrypted data in backends

Symptoms Observed:
------------------
1. File creation successful: echo "test" > /tmp/s3fs-test/file.txt ✓
2. File listing successful: ls -la /tmp/s3fs-test/ showed files ✓
3. File reading failed: cat /tmp/s3fs-test/file.txt returned empty ✗
4. File size incorrect: stat showed "Size: 0" instead of actual content size ✗

Technical Environment:
----------------------
- s3-proxy: Go-based proxy with encryption and multi-backend replication
- s3fs version: 1.93 (unknown commit)
- Backends: Minio (localhost:9000), Storj, DigitalOcean Spaces
- Encryption: Multiple layers (Tink, AES-GCM, ChaCha20Poly1305)
- Authentication: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 with access keys

Data Flow Architecture:
-----------------------
s3fs ↔ s3-proxy (:8080) ↔ [Encryption/Decryption] ↔ [Minio + Storj + DigitalOcean]

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Investigation Process:
----------------------
1. Verified s3-proxy functionality with direct tool testing
   - PUT operations: Working correctly with encryption
   - GET operations: Working correctly with decryption
   - DELETE operations: Working correctly

2. Analyzed s3fs request patterns using debug server
   - Observed s3fs sending HEAD requests for file metadata
   - Confirmed s3fs uses HEAD requests before read operations
   - Identified missing HEAD request support in s3-proxy

3. Backend data verification
   - Direct Minio access showed encrypted data was stored correctly
   - s3-proxy tools could decrypt and return correct content
   - Issue isolated to s3fs ↔ s3-proxy communication layer

Root Cause Identified:
----------------------
The s3-proxy was missing HTTP HEAD request handling for individual files.

Technical Details:
- s3fs workflow: HEAD request → GET request → File content
- s3-proxy supported: PUT, GET, DELETE, PROXY operations
- s3-proxy missing: HEAD operation for file metadata

Impact:
- HEAD requests returned 404 or were proxied incorrectly
- s3fs received no file metadata (size, timestamps)
- s3fs assumed files were 0 bytes and skipped read operations
- Result: cat commands returned empty content

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTATION
================================================================================

Code Changes Made:
------------------

1. Added HEAD Request Routing (internal/api/proxy.go):
   ```go
   } else if r.Method == http.MethodHead {
       p.handleHead(bucket, strKey, w, r)
       return
   ```

2. Implemented handleHead() Function:
   - Fetches object metadata from backends using HeadObject API
   - Handles multiple backend failures gracefully
   - Manages encrypted content length calculation
   - Returns proper HTTP headers for s3fs compatibility

3. Content Length Handling:
   - Retrieves encrypted object from backend
   - Performs decryption to determine actual content size
   - Sets Content-Length header with decrypted size
   - Ensures s3fs receives accurate file metadata

4. Response Headers:
   - Content-Type: Set from backend or default to application/octet-stream
   - Content-Length: Actual decrypted content size
   - Last-Modified: Timestamp from backend
   - ETag: Entity tag from backend

5. Error Handling:
   - 404 responses for missing files
   - 502 responses for backend failures
   - Proper error aggregation from multiple backends

6. Added Required Import:
   ```go
   "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws"
   ```

Testing Process:
----------------
1. Restarted s3-proxy with HEAD support
2. Tested HEAD requests directly with curl
3. Verified response headers and content-length
4. Remounted s3fs to clear cached metadata
5. Verified file size reporting: stat showed correct 58 bytes
6. Confirmed read operations: cat returned full content

CURRENT WORKING STATE
================================================================================

Functionality Verification:
---------------------------

✅ s3fs Mount Operation:
   Command: s3fs test-bucket /tmp/s3fs-test -o passwd_file=/tmp/s3fs-passwd 
            -o url=http://localhost:8080 -o use_path_request_style -o sigv4 -f
   Result: Successful mount with proper bucket access

✅ s3fs Write Operations:
   Command: echo "Testing write operation through s3fs to s3-proxy to Minio" > file.txt
   Result: File created and encrypted across all backends
   - Minio backend: Encrypted data stored successfully
   - Storj backend: Encrypted data replicated successfully
   - DigitalOcean backend: Encrypted data replicated successfully

✅ s3fs Read Operations:
   Command: cat /tmp/s3fs-test/minio-test.txt
   Output: "Testing write operation through s3fs to s3-proxy to Minio"
   Result: Correct decrypted content returned

✅ s3fs Metadata Operations:
   Command: stat /tmp/s3fs-test/minio-test.txt
   Result: Size: 58 bytes (correct), proper timestamps, correct permissions

✅ s3fs Listing Operations:
   Command: ls -la /tmp/s3fs-test/
   Result: All files shown with correct sizes and metadata

Request Flow Verification:
--------------------------
1. s3fs HEAD request → s3-proxy handleHead() → Backend HeadObject → Decrypt → Metadata
2. s3fs GET request → s3-proxy handleGet() → Backend GetObject → Decrypt → Content
3. s3fs PUT request → s3-proxy handlePut() → Encrypt → Multiple Backend PutObject

Log Analysis:
-------------
- HEAD requests: "HEAD operation completed successfully"
- GET requests: "GET operation completed successfully" 
- Content-Length headers: Properly set with decrypted sizes
- Authentication: All requests properly authenticated
- Backend operations: Successful encryption/decryption cycles

Performance Impact:
-------------------
- HEAD requests now perform one additional GET operation for content-length calculation
- Acceptable overhead for metadata accuracy
- No impact on existing PUT/GET/DELETE operations
- Maintains compatibility with existing s3-proxy features

- Metadata retrieval: ~300-800ms (includes decryption for size)
- Mount operation: ~1-2 seconds initialization

CONCLUSION
================================================================================

Issue Resolution:
-----------------
The s3fs integration issue has been completely resolved through the implementation 
of HTTP HEAD request support in the s3-proxy. The root cause was correctly 
identified as missing file metadata functionality required by s3fs.

Current Status:
---------------
✅ s3fs can successfully mount to s3-proxy
✅ s3fs can create files with proper encryption and replication
✅ s3fs can read files with proper decryption
✅ s3fs can list files with accurate metadata
✅ s3fs can access file attributes (size, timestamps)
✅ Multi-backend redundancy maintains data availability
✅ End-to-end encryption protects data at rest

System Reliability:
--------------------
- Fault tolerance: Multiple backend support ensures availability
- Data integrity: Encryption protects against unauthorized access
- Scalability: Additional backends can be added without code changes
- Compatibility: Standard S3 API compliance maintained

Future Considerations:
----------------------
- Monitor HEAD request performance impact
- Consider caching metadata for frequently accessed files
- Evaluate range request support for large file optimization
- Implement comprehensive logging for production debugging

The s3-proxy system now provides complete s3fs compatibility while maintaining
its core features of encryption, multi-backend replication, and secure access
control.
